# Power-BI---Used-Car-Dataset-TCV-visualization-
This document was prepared for a client on PeoplePerHour regarding thorough and comprehensive visualization of Japan's biggest Used car Marketplace.
The Data was in .csv format and was analyzed using Microsoft Power BI. Several individual visualizations were made to combine into an interactive
dashboard which was the need for client.
The analysis was concluded by creating a predictor model based on the different factors that affect the price of the car, which the user can manually
adjust to see the value of the car. The predictor model was based on linear regression and showed real-time results for the user. All of this was done
on Power BI as well.
